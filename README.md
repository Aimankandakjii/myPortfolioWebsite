# React JS Portfolio Website
## Welcome to my personal portfolio website, built using React JS. It showcases my skills as a developer 
To run the code locally, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. Once you have those, you can clone this repository and run the following command in the root directory:
npm install
This will install all of the necessary dependencies for the project. Next, you can run:
npm start
This command will start a development server and open the website in your default browser. You should now be able to see the website and make changes to the code.
If you want to build the project for production, you can run:
npm run build
This will create a "build" directory with optimized code that you can deploy to a live server.
If you have any questions or issues, feel free to open a GitHub issue or contact me directly. I'd be happy to help!
Thank you for checking out my portfolio website!
